## How to maintain the components directory
1. Copy/paste all the components or those you need from the parent radix 
theme under `radix/components` into your `SUBTHEME_NAME/components` directory.
Highly suggested to use [Radix CLI](https://github.com/doxigo/drupal-radix-cli) for easier management of the components.

2. Modify any corresponding template files in your sub-theme to use the 
copied components instead of the parent radix components.

3. Make sure that you import the `init.scss` into your components SASS 
file, the `block` component has been moved into the sub-theme as an example.

For more information, see the [Radix documentation on copying and modifying components](https://radix.trydrupal.com/radix/working-with-the-components/copy-and-modify-a-component).
